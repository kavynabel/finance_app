One option is to click the X in the top left sidebar and then hit ctrl p to print this page. If this doesn't look nice then download this file with the button below. Open it in Microsoft Excel, and print it out. A Harvard Business study looked at MBA graduates and found that the 3% who wrote their goals down earned 10 times as much money as the remaining 97%. Putting pen to paper forces you to think about your goals and what youâ€™re trying to achieve. Think about this as you physically write how much you spend in these categories each week.")
