I created a streamlit app to help make some financial struggles easier. I have a stock back tester and stock analysis to help with management of stocks. A mortgage calculator, budget template, and retirement planning tool. These files are here to make my streamlit app deployment work. Here is the link to the completed app: https://kavynabel-finance-app-home-wz8nk7.streamlit.app/
